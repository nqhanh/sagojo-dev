"\t<li><strong>What it does:</strong> Deeplink Juggernaut lets you "
"automatically generate hyperlinks in your site&#8217;s content and footer.</"
"li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Search engines use the anchor text of "
"hyperlinks to determine the topicality of the webpage to which the link "
"points. Deeplink Juggernaut lets you automatically generate hyperlinks to "
"various pages on your site, which can help increase the linked page&#8217;s "
"ranking for the term used in the anchor text.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>How to use it:</strong> The Content Links section lets you "
"automatically link words or phrases in your site&#8217;s content to a target "
"page of your choosing. The Footer Links section lets you add links in the "
"footer of your entire site or just a particular set of webpages.</li>\n"

"your site&#8217;s content for the word or phrase you put in this box, and "
"then hyperlink instances of that word or phrase to the webpage or item you "
"specify in the Destination box. The Anchor Text should be a keyword that you "

"\t<li><p><strong>Destination</strong> &mdash; This is the box where you "

"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>To link to a post, page, attachment, category, tag, term, or "

"\t\t\t<li>To link to your blog homepage, just type in &#8220;home&#8221; and "

"\t<li><p><strong>Dampener:</strong> If the anchor text you specify occurs "
"many times throughout your site&#8217;s content, you may wish to reduce the "
"overall frequency with which the anchor text is hyperlinked. You can reduce "
"the autolinking frequency by a percentage with the Dampener field. For "
"example:</p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>0% dampening will have no effect.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>50% dampening means the anchor text will be autolinked "

"\t\t\t<li>90% dampening means the anchor text will be autolinked only 10% as "
"often as it otherwise would be.</li>\n"

"<p>The following options are available on the Content Link Settings tab:</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Add Autolinks to...</strong> &mdash; You can stop Deeplink "
"Juggernaut from adding hyperlinks to the content of items of a given post "
"type by unchecking the post type&#8217;s checkbox.</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t\t<p><strong>Self-Linking</strong></p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Allow posts to link to themselves</strong> &mdash; This "
"permits Deeplink Juggernaut to add a link to the content of a given post/"
"page even if the link is pointing to the URL of that post/page.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Allow posts to link to the URL by which the visitor is "
"accessing the post</strong> &mdash; There are lots of URLs by which you can "
"access any given post/page on your site. You can access posts/pages via the "
"homepage URL, your site&#8217;s many archive URLs, or the URLs of the posts/"
"pages themselves. If you have an autolink that points to the homepage, and "
"if Deeplink Juggernaut were to add that link to the content of posts when "
"those posts are accessed from the homepage, then the homepage would be "
"linking to itself. By default, Deeplink Juggernaut won&#8217;t let this "
"happen. But if you&#8217;re okay with that sort of behavior, you can enable "
"it by checking this box.</li>\n"
"\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t\t<p><strong>Quantity Restrictions</strong></p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Don&#8217;t add any more than ___ autolinks per post/page/"
"etc.</strong> &mdash; Use this option to cap the total number of autolinks "
"(for all anchor texts combined) that can be added to the content of any one "
"item.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Don&#8217;t link the same anchor text any more than ___ "
"times per post/page/etc.</strong> &mdash; Use this option to cap the number "
"of times that each anchor text can be autolinked in the content of any one "
"item.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Don&#8217;t link to the same destination any more than ___ "
"times per post/page/etc.</strong> &mdash; Use this option to cap the number "
"of autolinks that any one URL can get within the content of any one item. "
"(This is different from the previous option because you can have multiple "
"anchor texts pointing to the same place.)</li>\n"
"\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t\t<p><strong>Additional Dampening Effect</strong></p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Globally decrease autolinking frequency by ___%</strong> "
"&mdash; If you have massive amounts of content on your site (e.g. thousands "
"of posts), the &#8220;Quantity Restrictions&#8221; settings may not be "
"sufficient to reign in the number of autolinks being generated. If that is "
"the case, you can use this option to reduce overall autolinking frequency by "
"a given percentage. For example, if you were to set global dampening to 10%, "
"then autolinks would be added only 90% as often as before.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li><strong>Add a &#8220;Dampener&#8221; column to the Content Links "
"editor</strong> &mdash; Check this box and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; "
"to add a new column to the &#8220;Content Links&#8221; editor table that "
"will let you apply the dampening effect to individual autolinks. If "
"you&#8217;ve also enabled the global dampening option, this will let you "
"override the global value for individual links. (For example, you can "
"disable dampening for just one of your links by setting the Dampener field "
"to 0%.)</li>\n"
"\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Tag Restrictions</strong> &mdash; By default, Deeplink "
"Juggernaut will not autolink a particular anchor text if that anchor text is "
"found in a header or in a code block. You can further customize these "
"exceptions by adding HTML tags to the list.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Siloing</strong> &mdash; If you enable the siloing feature for "
"a given post type (such as posts or pages), then items of that post type "
"will only be able to autolink to a webpage on your site if it falls within a "
"category, tag, or term shared by that item. For example, you can set it up "
"so that posts in Category A can&#8217;t autolink to anything on your site "
"with the exception of other posts in Category A and the Category A archive. "
"Autolinks to external sites will not be affected, since the siloing setting "
"will not affect autolinks that have a URL in the Destination box.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>CSS Class for Autolinks</strong> &mdash; If you want to apply "
"CSS styling to Content Links generated by Deeplink Juggernaut, type in a "
"class name here (e.g. &#8220;autolink&#8221;).</li>\n"

"Customizing_the_Read_More' target='_blank'>&#8220;more&#8221; links</a>.</"
"li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Why it helps:</strong> On the typical WordPress setup, the "
"&#8220;more link&#8221; always has the same anchor text (e.g. &#8220;Read "
"more of this entry&#8221;). Since internal anchor text conveys web page "
"topicality to search engines, the &#8220;read more&#8221; phrase isn&#8217;t "
"a desirable anchor phrase. More Link Customizer lets you replace the "
"boilerplate text with a new anchor that, by default, integrates your post "
"titles (which will ideally be keyword-oriented).</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>How to use it:</strong> On this page you can set the anchor "
"text you&#8217;d like to use by default. The <code>{post}</code> variable "
"will be replaced with the post&#8217;s title. HTML and encoded entities are "
"supported. If instead you decide that you&#8217;d like to use the default "
"anchor text specified by your currently-active theme, just erase the "
"contents of the textbox. The anchor text can be overridden on a per-post "
"basis via the &#8220;More Link Text&#8221; box in the &#8220;SEO "
"Settings&#8221; section of the WordPress post editor.</li>\n"

"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>\n"
"\t\t<p><strong>Why is the More Link Customizer an improvement over "
"WordPress&#8217;s built-in functionality?</strong><br />Although WordPress "
"does allow basic <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/"
"Customizing_the_Read_More#Having_a_custom_text_for_each_post' "
"target='_blank'>custom &#8220;more&#8221; anchors</a>, the SEO Ultimate "
"approach has several benefits:</p>\n"
"\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>More Link Customizer (MLC) lets you set a custom default anchor "
"text. WordPress, on the other hand, leaves this up to the currently-active "
"theme.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>MLC lets you dynamically incorporate the post&#8217;s title into "
"the anchor text.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>MLC lets you include HTML tags in your anchor, whereas WordPress "
"strips these out.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>MLC&#8217;s functionality is much more prominent than "
"WordPress&#8217;s unintuitive, barely-documented approach.</li>\n"
"\t\t\t<li>Unlike WordPress's method, MLC doesn't require you to utilize the "
"HTML editor.</li>\n"
"\t\t</ul>\n"
"\t\t<p>If you&#8217;ve already specified custom anchors via WordPress&#8217;"
"s method, SEO Ultimate will import those anchors automatically into the More "
"Link Customizer.</p>\n"

"search engines to display special pertinent information (known as Rich "
"Snippets) in search results for certain types of content. For example, if "
"you&#8217;ve written a product review, you can use Rich Snippet Creator to "
"ask Google to display the star rating that you gave the product in your "
"review next to your review webpage when it appears in search results.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Rich Snippet Creator enhances the "
"search engine results for your content by asking Google to add extra, eye-"
"catching info that could help draw in more search engine visitors.</li>\n"
"\t<li><strong>How it works:</strong> When editing one of your posts or "
"pages, see if your content fits one of the available rich snippet types (for "
"example, a review). If so, select that type from the &#8220;Search Result "
"Type&#8221; dropdown box. Once you select the applicable type, additional "
"options will appear that vary based on the type selected. For example, a "
"&#8220;Star Rating for Reviewed Item&#8221; field will appear if you select "
"the &#8220;Review&#8221; type. Once you save the post/page, Rich Snippet "
"Creator will add the special code to it. You can remove this code at any "
"time by selecting &#8220;Standard&#8221; from the &#8220;Search Result "
"Type&#8221; dropdown and resaving the post/page.</li>\n"
