Resume Page does one thing; it turns any page into a Resume Page. It has all the built in basics for what a resume needs, and more! It follows the traditional resume layout, and is completely customizable with built in design options and an area for custom CSS. You could turn every page of your site into a different resume page. It also has a smart templating feature that let's developers in the house easily override the template. Just drop it into your child theme, and mod away. 

It's just that simple.
